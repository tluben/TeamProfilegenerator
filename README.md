# Starter Code v2
After review of the solution (and feedback from another class currently tackling this homework), we've decided to provided more starter code to help you with this assignment. Please use the code provided in this folder as your starter code, and focus on the following:

* Build out `Employee.js`, `Engineer.js`, `Intern.js`, and `Manager.js` in the `lib` folder. With exception to `htmlRenderer.js` (provided), the files in this folder will all be classes and will be used as blueprints for generating specific types of employee objects. Refer to the instructions for more information as to the specific properties and methods each class should contain. I recommend building these classes out first and testing them to verify they generate objects of the correct structure. In order for the code provided in `htmlRenderer.js` to work, the objects generated must strictly match the structure indicated in the assignment instructions.

* Build out code inside of the `app.js`. This file will be the entry point of your app (the file you run in your command line to kick off the app). See the comments within this file for guidance as to what the code should do.

* Once your code is functioning, spend some time studying `htmlRenderer.js` inside of the `lib` folder to understand how it works. After you have an understanding of how the code works and interfaces with both the HTML templates and `app.js`, write up a paragraph explaining your findings. Please include this explanation as a comment in BCS when you submit your assignment.

* Run your automated tests frequently using the command `npm test`. Use the results of the tests to guide you as you build the functionality out bit-by-bit.

##### HINT: the code remaining in `app.js` was left intentionally.
